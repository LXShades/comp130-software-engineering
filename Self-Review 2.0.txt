Notes
- Determine how to quote: Companies with unknown authors, Websites, etc.
- Fix uncapitalised month names in references
- 'The goal is to propose design patterns' - Instead propose an architecture, maybe focus less on the existing strategies
- Shorten some of the bullet points in the intro
- The market section poses more questions than answers. Try drawing more links and finding answers
- First paragraph of player experience could be removed. The next paragraph could be begin with 'in a study of video viewers', and then illustrate the potential link later, and link it to the game experience
- ALso note how small sections can be joined together into one large level.
- The Existing Strategies section could be removed or replaced

In the proposal:
