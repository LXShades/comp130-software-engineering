Appropriateness of Referenced Articles: 2-3, may need more scholarly research
Relevance to and Focus on the Research Question: 2-3, research question is too vague
Depth of Insight into Engineering Principles: 1 - Could use more technical detail on te problem
Specifity, Verifiability of Claims: 3-4 - could just use some more citations
Adequacy of Analysis of Research: 2 - needs to draw some more points from the articles
Adequacy of Justification of Approached and Techniques: 2 - I mean, it was rushed. Solution doesn't refer explicitly to the game industry
Appropriateness of Academic Writing: 3-4, hopefully

Main areas of action:
- Analysis of research, draw more points from articles
- Depth of Insight, more technical detil
- Consider rewriting the research question

Notes:
- Question seems to focus on 'What C++ architecture', which is a very broad question.
- Consider alternatives: 
  - How can parallelism benefit QoE-oriented map streaming?
- Consider using something other than Google Trends to reference Fortnite and Minecraft.
- Restructure 'low-detail constant frame streaming' sentence, and draw an interesting pointfrom it that can justify our eventual solution
- 'While this is researched primarily in FPSes and MMOs rather than building games',
- At the end of Existing Strategies, met=ntion that texture streaming might not be a factor and could eliminate the problem

- Consider picking up Code Complete
